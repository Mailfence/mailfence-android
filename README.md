## Mailfence Secure and Private Email Service - Privacy is a right, not a feature

Mailfence is a private and secure email service, offering an integrated suite of tools including Emails, Calendars, Online Storage, Contacts and more. Mailfence is available via our [web app](https://mailfence.com/) and our mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/be/app/encrypted-email-mailfence/id1628808776) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contactoffice.mailfence&hl=en)).

**The aim of this repo is to:**

* allow people who do not want to or cannot use the PlayStore to [download the APK directly;](https://github.com/Mailfence/mailfence-android/releases/)
* report issues directly in Github;
* please note that the goal *is not to make the code Open Source/Public Source at this time.*
